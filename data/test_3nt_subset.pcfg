# 3 non-start NTs (A, B, C) where A's context distribution is a
# PROPER SUBSET of C's.  A only appears adjacent to C (in S->AC
# and S->CA), while C also appears adjacent to A, B, and C.
# B is fully distinguishable (appears adjacent to B and C).
# No two NTs are identical.
#
# Context sets:
#   A: {(BOS, c-word), (c-word, EOS)}
#   C: {(BOS, a-word), (BOS, b-word), (BOS, c-word),
#        (a-word, EOS), (c-word, EOS)}
#   B: {(BOS, b-word), (b-word, EOS), (c-word, EOS)}
#   A ⊂ C, A ⊄ B, B ⊄ C
#
# Expected failure: algorithm incorrectly rejects C as a "mixture"
# because D(a||c) is small (A's contexts ⊂ C's contexts) while
# D(c||a) is large (C has contexts where A is absent), creating
# a false mixture asymmetry signature.
