This is code for reproducing the experiments in the paper 
"Consistent unsupervised estimators for anchored PCFGs" in TACL, 2020.
Alexander Clark and Nathanel Fijalkow.

We are grateful to Mark Johnson for his efficient C implementation of the IO algorithm; downloaded from

These experiments use synthetic grammars that are generated by another library
